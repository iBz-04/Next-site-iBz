        <p>
          We believe that our strength lies in our collaborative approach, which
          puts our clients at the center of everything we do.
        </p>

            iBz was started by friends who noticed that developer studios were
            charging clients double what an in-house team would cost. Since the
            beginning, we have been committed to doing things differently by
            charging triple instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            At iBz, we’re more than just colleagues — we’re a family. This means
            we pay very little and expect people to work late. We want our
            employees to bring their whole selves to work. In return, we just
            ask that they keep themselves there until at least 7:00pm.
