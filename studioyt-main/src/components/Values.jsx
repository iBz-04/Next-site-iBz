        <p>
          We strive to stay at the forefront of emerging trends and
          technologies, while completely ignoring them and forking that old
          Rails project we feel comfortable using. We stand by our core values
          to justify that decision.

            The first part of any partnership is getting our designer to put
            your logo in our template. The second step is getting them to do the
            colors.
          </GridListItem>
          <GridListItem title="Efficient">
            We pride ourselves on never missing a deadline which is easy because
            most of the work was done years ago.
          </GridListItem>
          <GridListItem title="Adaptable">
            Every business has unique needs and our greatest challenge is
            shoe-horning those needs into something we already built.
          </GridListItem>
          <GridListItem title="Honest">
            We are transparent about all of our processes, banking on the simple
            fact our clients never actually read anything.
          </GridListItem>
          <GridListItem title="Loyal">
            We foster long-term relationships with our clients that go beyond
            just delivering a product, allowing us to invoice them for decades.
          </GridListItem>
          <GridListItem title="Innovative">
            The technological landscape is always evolving and so are we. We are
            constantly on the lookout for new open source projects.
